# Sortable Coding Challenge

My entry for the Sortable coding challenge at http://sortable.com/blog/coding-challenge/.

## Usage

Clone and run `index.php`, either through the command line or by visiting it in a browser.

Input: `listings.txt` and `products.txt` should be in the same directory as the script.

Output: writes `results.txt` in the same directory as the script.
